         <h2>About</h2>
         <p>
         My name is Tanu Upadhyay, and I'm a 3rd year student currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. I'm passionate about programming and Frontend Development and constantly strive to improve my skills in these areas. Additionally, I'm also learning the basic Graphics designing to expand my knowledge in these fields.</p>
        <p>Problem solving has always been a favorite pastime of mine, and I love to brainstorm and come up with new ideas for startup. As a hobby, I enjoy reading articles on human behavior psychology and occasionally delve into self-help books to gain insights and inspiration.</p>
